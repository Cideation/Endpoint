# FINAL PHASE: ECM GATEWAY + OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM

## üìå Abstract

The final phase of the SOS architecture combines two core runtime operations:
1. **Environmental Computation Matrix (ECM)** ‚Äî A persistent WebSocket-FSM gateway that orchestrates environmental sensing and functor routing.
2. **Graph-Based Optimization System** ‚Äî A training pipeline that analyzes node outputs, edge interactions, and agent coefficients using DGL and NetworkX to optimize system behavior.

This fusion forms the runtime intelligence of the system: ECM handles live interaction, while optimization ensures continuous learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ECM Gateway 

### Core Features
- FSM-based routing for all node interactions
- WebSocket server connected to Unreal/External UI
- Executes scientific functors (from SFDE) dynamically
- Updates node state maps and logs transitions

### Key Files
- `ecm_gateway.py`: Main WebSocket handler
- `fsm_runtime.py`: FSM engine per node
- `fsm_matrix.ecm`: DSL file defining state transitions
- `functor_router.py`: Executes functor logic based on FSM
- `agent_state.json`: Cache of current agent-node states

---

## üß† Optimization System 

### Core Features
- Uses DGL to analyze node/edge embeddings
- Trains models to optimize:
  - ROI
  - Occupancy matching
  - Spec-fit scoring
- Updates PostgreSQL/ECM thresholds in real-time

### Key Files
- `graph_training_engine.py`: DGL-based learner
- `embedding_optimizer.py`: Refines coefficient/edge parameters
- `objective_scoring.py`: Applies goals to graph
- `postgres_updater.py`: Injects learning outputs back to storage

## üîÅ Combined Runtime Loop

```text
Unreal / UI ‚Üí ECM Gateway ‚Üí Functor Execution ‚Üí DGL Learning ‚Üí Graph Update / Threshold Adjustment
```

Each pulse updates not only the node FSM but also contributes to future graph optimization and smarter emergent behaviors.

## ‚úÖ Result

- Live node control (via ECM)
- Continuous learning (via DGL)
- Agent and coefficient-sensitive edge behavior
- Supports emergent strategies across combinatorial node links

# SOS System Data Lake Architecture

This system operates with **two coordinated data lakes**:

---

## 1. PostgreSQL Lake ‚Äì Canonical Source of Truth

- **Purpose**: Stores structured, validated system data (nodes, edges, coefficients, formulas).
- **Format**: Relational (SQL tables and views)
- **Used For**:
  - Runtime microservices (Phase 2)
  - Graph construction
  - Functor execution and edge evaluation
- **Populated By**: Phase 2 Runtime Modules, JSON parsers, and environment generators

---

## 2. Training Data Lake ‚Äì Machine Learning Context

- **Purpose**: Prepares and structures data for training SFDE (Scientific Formula Discovery Engine) and other ML models.
- **Format**: Graphs, tensors, CSVs, embedding matrices
- **Used For**:
  - Graph learning with DGL
  - Emergence training (Phase 4)
  - Formula completion, combinatorial inference
- **Populated By**: SQL exports, functor-enriched outputs, feature transformers

---

## üîÅ Relationship

- PostgreSQL is the **input** and **reference base** for the training lake.
- Training data is a **derived mirror**, often snapshotting current system states + functor evaluations.
- They stay loosely coupled via:
  - Materialized views
  - Scheduled exports
  - Functor tagging + variable alignment

---

## üîí Recommendation

- Treat PostgreSQL as **immutable and curated**.
- Treat the Training Data Lake as **ephemeral and experimental** ‚Äî refreshed per training cycle.
