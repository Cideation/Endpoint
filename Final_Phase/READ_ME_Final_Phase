# FINAL PHASE: ECM GATEWAY + OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM

## üìå Abstract

The final phase of the SOS architecture combines two core runtime operations:
1. **Environmental Computation Matrix (ECM)** ‚Äî A persistent WebSocket-FSM gateway that orchestrates environmental sensing and functor routing.
2. **Graph-Based Optimization System** ‚Äî A training pipeline that analyzes node outputs, edge interactions, and agent coefficients using DGL and NetworkX to optimize system behavior.

This fusion forms the runtime intelligence of the system: ECM handles live interaction, while optimization ensures continuous learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ECM Gateway 

### Core Features
- FSM-based routing for all node interactions
- WebSocket server connected to Unreal/External UI
- Executes scientific functors (from SFDE) dynamically
- Updates node state maps and logs transitions

### Key Files
- `ecm_gateway.py`: Main WebSocket handler
- `fsm_runtime.py`: FSM engine per node
- `fsm_matrix.ecm`: DSL file defining state transitions
- `functor_router.py`: Executes functor logic based on FSM
- `agent_state.json`: Cache of current agent-node states

## üß† Optimization System 

### Core Features
- Uses DGL to analyze node/edge embeddings
- Trains models to optimize:
  - ROI
  - Occupancy matching
  - Spec-fit scoring
- Updates PostgreSQL/ECM thresholds in real-time

### Key Files
- `graph_training_engine.py`: DGL-based learner
- `embedding_optimizer.py`: Refines coefficient/edge parameters
- `objective_scoring.py`: Applies goals to graph
- `postgres_updater.py`: Injects learning outputs back to storage

## üîÅ Combined Runtime Loop

```text
Unreal / UI ‚Üí ECM Gateway ‚Üí Functor Execution ‚Üí DGL Learning ‚Üí Graph Update / Threshold Adjustment
```

Each pulse updates not only the node FSM but also contributes to future graph optimization and smarter emergent behaviors.

## ‚úÖ Result

- Live node control (via ECM)
- Continuous learning (via DGL)
- Agent and coefficient-sensitive edge behavior
- Supports emergent strategies across combinatorial node links
